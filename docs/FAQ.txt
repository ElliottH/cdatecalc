Q. How do I get the current date and time in UNIX?

A. UNIX is batshit. It runs its clock in TAI (i.e. disregarding leap seconds), but synchronises it to UTC via
 ntp, the value of a correctly synchronised UNIX clock is actually different from that of an ideal free-running
 UNIX clock. This requires some finesse:

  * Create a calendar_time_t corresponding to the UNIX epoch
  { 1970, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, CDC_SYSTEM_GREGORIAN_TAI, 0 }
 
  * Now create an interval from the output of time() :

    cdc_interval_t ival;
    ival.s = time(NULL);
    ival.ns = 0;

   * Add the two:

   cdc_zone_add( tai_zone, &out, &epoch, &ival );

   * And reflect the fact that UNIX has synced to UTC, not TAI:
    out.system = CDC_SYSTEM_UTC 

  Note that if you're using the C++ API , you'll want to use a calendar time with the AS_IF_NS flag
 set instead of an interval - the two are, in GREGORIAN_TAI, identical.
